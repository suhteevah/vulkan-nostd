//! ICD dispatch table and function pointer resolution — vkGetInstanceProcAddr,

//! This implements the Vulkan ICD (Installable Client Driver) interface. Since
//! bare-metal OS has no Vulkan loader, this dispatch table IS the full Vulkan
//! implementation. DXVK and other consumers call directly through these
